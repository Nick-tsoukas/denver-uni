Get It Right

After reading the Get It Right chapter in the precourse work, I discovered that Finding the Squad to be most challenging keys to success. Although I love to pair program and help others, I'm often reluctant and fearful of sharing my own.

To overcome this challenge, I will take, lack of personal knowledge and bugs in my code, as good indicators of what I need to work on next. Also, Iâ€™ll remind myself to be grateful for being around other students that share the same programming goals. Lastly, I'll work very hard but remember to enjoy an opportunity for learning in a highly collaborative environment at the University of Denver.
